## Directions
1. Clone and cd into this repo.
2. Run the file with the command: `node yeti.rb`. 
3. Write down what you think the error message means.
4. Fix the error.
5. Repeat step 2-4 until there are no more errors. You will know you are making progress if the error messages change.
6. You've corrected all the errors when you see the single line `We'll have to outwit the Bumble with our superior intelligence.` outputted to your terminal.
